            STEP 1: SETTING UP YOUR WALLET

          <Heading color="#F06543" as="h3" p="7.5" fontSize={{ base: 'xl', md: '2xl' }} fontWeight="extrabold" mb={5} >What is a wallet?</Heading>
          <Text>A crypto wallet is like a bank account on steroids. 
          Think about it, any financial service you use, (PayPal, Credit Card, Stripe...) needs to be linked to a bank account. Not just for funding, but for verification.
          In crypto, your wallet is what connects you to the DeFi applications and blockchains that exist. 
          </Text>
          <Heading color="#F06543" as="h3" p="7.5" fontSize={{ base: 'xl', md: '2xl' }} fontWeight="extrabold" mb={5} >
          Why are we using wallets?
          </Heading>
          <Text>Your wallet acts as your log-in for crypto apps. Just like when a website asks you "Would you like to log-in with Facebook / Google?‚Äù. 
            Whats worthy to note is that unlike centralized login & authentication technology, the most beneficial crypto applications are censorship-resistant,
            meaning there is very few ways to limit someone from interacting with the features an application provides. This differs from what we find our culture 
            relying on with digital applications and services, and is why our team is willing to take the time to create applications like this.

          How do I get my own wallet?
          </Heading>
          <Text>The wallets that are compatible with the ticket application  are supported on most platforms (Mobile, Web-Browser, Cold-Wallet).
             While getting comfotable with managing your wallets, we have created some best practices that we have learned from our journey:</Text>
             <Heading  textAlign="left" as="h5" p="7.5" fontSize={{ base: 'sm', md: 'sm' }} fontWeight="extrabold" mb={1} >
            Treat your private keys like vital organs.
             </Heading>
             <Text textAlign="left" fontSize={{ base: 'xs', md: 'xs' }} >
              Private keys are the private piece of data that wallets require in order to successfully sign & send transactions. This data is unique to each wallet, 
             so if someone ends up with your wallets private key, the wallet will sign & broadcast and messages that they want, which is how we frequently see exploits & hacks occur.
             in that wallet. Store keys on trustworthy key manager apps, or even better write them on a piece of paper and put it somewhere where you know it will be safe.</Text>
             <Heading  textAlign="left" as="h5" p="7.5" fontSize={{ base: 'sm', md: 'sm' }} fontWeight="extrabold" mb={1} >
            Redundancy.
             </Heading>
             <Text textAlign="left" fontSize={{ base: 'xs', md: 'xs' }} >
              There is no cost for making a new wallet, so do not be frugal with creating new wallets, just be sure you keep track of private keys securely! Since, Hot Wallets (software, online based) like Keplr & Leap are less secure
              than Cold Wallets (Hardware, offline based), if you have a wallet that hold any substancial amount of tokens, it might be best practice to use other wallets for frequent task, so that the expore time to accessing your private key is as minimal as possible.
